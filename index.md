# Do you know Devin?
Hi there, my name is Devin Harris and I'm just another human being, inhabiting this small but wonderful planet. I'm **neurodiverse** a father, husband and veteran of the [US Navy](https://www.navy.mil/).

I'm originally from Texas (Oak Cliff) but now I live near Charleston South Carolina. I'm a hacker at heart, but I'm not a Security Researcher, Pentester or Black Hat I just possess the curiosity, adventuresome spirit, and love of tinkering, building, and breaking that is what goes into the [Hacker Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture). I started programming at a very young age and I never really stopped.

My [career](/career) has been long and windy just as my [personal](/personal) life has and while I'm fairly open and transparent I also understand the need for [Operational Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security) and as such will limit information shared on this site; if you want to get to know me better than really get to know me.
